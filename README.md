```gradle
repositories {
  maven {
    url "https://maven.topi.wtf/releases"
  }
}

dependencies {
  implementation "com.github.topi314.lavalyrics:lavalyrics:x.y.z"
}
```
</details>

### Using in Maven:

<details>
<summary>Maven</summary>

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <url>https://maven.topi.wtf/releases</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.topi314.lavalyrics</groupId>

### Usage

Create new `LyricsManager`:

// register your lyrics sources
lyricsManager.registerLyricsManager(source);
```

```java
var audioLyrics = lyricsManager.loadLyrics(AudioTrack, skipTrackSource);
```

Then you can do what you want with this:
```java
List<AudioLyrics.Line> lines = audioLyrics.getLines();
if (lines != null) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (AudioLyrics.Line line : lines) {
          sb.append(line.getLine()).append("\n");
        }
}
System.out.println(sb); // Output: Line by line text
```
